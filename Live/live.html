        <h2>Michael horses</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the 72-acre farm at Kentucky Equine Adoption Center. The horses seen here were surrendered due to abuse, abandonment, neglect, or from owners who can no longer care for them. Each horse will enter a retraining program to get it ready for adoption into a loving home. The goal is to make the right match between horse and adopter!        </p>

        <h2>Saving Puppies</h2>
        <p>
            "These are the horses who live in the field behind my house. I was only able to get but so much footage due to it starting to rain though. Four incredibly dear puppies came close to losing their lives in a horrendous accident when they stumbled into spilled tar in a garbage pile. When the first one wandered in and got stuck, she must have cried with so much emotion that the others came to see what was the matter, and they too got glued down by the awful tar. We knew they had a mother, but we couldn't find her until the day following their rescue and the hours-long process of removing the tar with oil and dish soap.
